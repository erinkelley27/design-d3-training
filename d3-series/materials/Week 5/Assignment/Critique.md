# Week 5 Viz Critique

## Positives

* I like how this viz takes the content it's displaying and themes it to how it is being displayed. It's dramatic and immediately gets the point across.
* I like that important events are pointed out on the timeline.

## Negtaives

* It's not immediately clear who the victims are. Does the viz represent American fatalities, military, or all victims?
* There is a label in the middle of the viz that displays coalition and civilialian death counts at a certain point in time. But the breakdown isn't displayed anywhere else.
* The gray scale of the smaller visualizations doesn't draw my eye to them. In particular, the map's color scale doesn't have a lot of contrast.
