# Week 3 Assignment: Critique

## Viz 1: Return Frequency Website Scorecard

* It is clear and simple what the visualization is displaying.
* This viz seems to be objective and focused.
* The key of this visualization seems redundant. It displays the same information twice, so the color differentiation doesn't seem to be needed. The bars could just be labeled within the viz.
* I think a color differentiation in the key could be used to display in season v. off season visits to the web site.
* I would be interested to see if this color palette of this viz would be considered to be accessible.
* The gridron of the football field probably isn't necessary, but I kind of like it.

## Viz 2: Bubbles

* I really like the interactivity of this visualization.
* I had to watch a tutorial on how to use this tool before understanding its purpose. I think that should be clearer from the beginning. Adding a dynamic header based on user selections could be helpful.
* Having bubbles of different sizes is a cool idea, but the size of the bubble does not alway have any relevance. For example, does it matter how big the population is if we just want to know the average life expectancy?
* I think in general, there is too much info here. It's not focused, and it's not simple. I like the idea that a user can customize the data they want to see, but I think that it should be simplified.
