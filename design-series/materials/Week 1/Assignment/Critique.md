# Week 1 Assignment: Critique

## Viz 1

### Positives

* I like the color scheme here.
* The products appear on the same order as the key for each strategy.

### Negatives

* The visualization is very busy. It's hard to focus on the what it's trying to tell the viewer. My eye has to jump around a lot to focus on comparing the individual products across strategies.
* Having the key at the top adds too much to what's already going on.
* There are two labels for the Y-axis, 'Product's Values' and 'Total of amount', which makes it difficult to know what is actually being measured.

## My Visualization 

* I changed this visualization to a stacked bar graph. I thought that the most important takeaway from the visualization would be the total number of products sold across strategies, so I added the "Total Product Sales" label to the Y-axis. This graph indicates that more clearly so that the viewer can see which strategy was the most or least successful.
* By stacking the products according to color, the user can get a basic overview of which strategy worked best for each product. It's also easier to compare individual products across strategies at a glance because the eye can follow the colors horizontally.
* I moved the key to the right side because it seemed like a more intuitive place for a reference.
* A added a grid to background of the graph so that it was easier for the viewer to compare strategies that have total product sales values that are close.

## Viz 2

### Positives

* N/A

### Negatives

* This resolution is pretty low. I can't read the key at the bottom of the page.
* There are 27 different colors used in this visualization, which makes it difficult for me to easily associate the color with the product.
* The visualization is very cluttered.
* There is no indication what the percentages in the red and blue boxes represent.
* There isn't a label for the Y-axis.
* There isn't an overall label or title describing what the visualization should be showing.
* There is a number within each section of the bar and a percentage next to the bar, which is distracting.
* It's unclear what the percentages next to the bars represent - the percentage does not correlate with the size of the block it seems to be representing.
* Some of the blocks don't have percentages.

## My Visualization

I couldn't read the key in the provided visualization because it was super fuzzy. I tried to figure out what information was being displayed and decided to make the updated visualization about montly over-the-counter medication sales.

* I changed the color scheme to make it easier to look at. The other color scheme was kind of jarring and made me want to stop looking at it.
* There was a ton of data being displayed in the provided visualization, so I reduced the number of retailers being displayed from 17 to 4. I added a 5th category to the key that encompassed all other retailers. I thought that simplifying the amount of data presented would showcase the most popular retailers a little more clearly. Many of the retailers displayed in the original visualization had such small contributions to total sales, so I wanted to compile their impact on total sales into one category.
* I added labels to the visualizatoin so that it was clearer what data/trends it was intended to represent.
* I removed the values and percentages from within the graph. I wasn't sure what they were supposed to represent, but I think there could be some benefit to having some kind of value displayed within the visualization.

## Viz 3

### Positives

* This visualization is simple, and the information being conveyed is fairly clear.

### Negatives

* Only two of the ways Boomers describe themselves have explanatory statements next to them, which seem to be structured like a survey question that was answered. This should be consistent for all of the descriptions. Either all of them should have a statement, or none of them.
* The shape of the body makes doesn't accurately display which descriptions had the highest percentages. For example, "Willing to Learn" looks like the biggest block, but the largest percentage is actualyl "People-Savvy".
* The percentages are not in any kind of order. If they were in a order, the viewer might be able to more easily see which descriptions were the most or least popular.
* The font size of the percentages is larger than then title of the visualization.

## My Visualization 

* I removed the explantory statements from the visualization to keep the information provided consistent from Boomer description to description.
* I decided to display the information in bars instead of a graphic of a body. I felt like the provided visualization made it seem like the percentages should add up to 100% since they were each being used to make up part of the body. Since the Baby Boomer who answered the survey could answer "agree" to multiple prompts, I though they should be separated out.
* I made the bars reflect the actual percentages they represent. In the provided visualization, the body didn't reflect the percentages very well. Based on the shape of the torso, it seemed like the highest percentage of Baby Boomers agreed with "Willing to Learn", when the actual highest percentage agreed with "People-Savvy". Also, it seemed like the difference between "Creative" and "Leaders" was much larger than it actually is.
* I placed the bars in order of highest to lowest percentage so that it would be easier for the viewer to pick up on what the most or least Baby Boomers agreed with.
